abstract = {Invertebrate animal models are experimentally tractable and have immunity and disease symptoms that mirror those of vertebrates. Therefore they are of particular utility in understanding fundamental aspects of pathogenesis. Indeed, artificial models using human pathogens and invertebrate hosts have revealed conserved and novel molecular mechanisms of bacterial infection and host immune responses. Additional insights may be gained from investigating interactions between invertebrates and pathogens they encounter in their natural environments. For example, enteric bacteria in the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are pathogens of insects that also mutualistically associate with nematodes in the genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema respectively. These bacteria serve as models to understand naturally occurring symbiotic associations that result in disease in or benefit for animals. Xenorhabdus nematophila is the best-studied species of its genus with regard to the molecular mechanisms of its symbiotic associations. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding X. nematophila-host interactions. We emphasize regulatory cascades involved in coordinating transitions between various stages of the X. nematophila life cycle: infection, reproduction and transmission.},

abstract = {An entomopathogenic bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophila, is known to depress hemocyte nodule formation of target insects by inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis. This study analyzed the inhibitory effect of X. nematophila on the humoral immunity of the target insects and tested its association with the host eicosanoid pathway. Plasma collected from the fifth instar larvae of Spodoptera exigua, when they were injected with X. nematophila, did not show antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli by a growth inhibition zone assay. In comparison, heat-killed X. nematophila induced significant antibacterial activity in the plasma. The antibacterial humoral activity was further demonstrated by examining a specific potent antibacterial peptide, cecropin. Two cecropin genes ('A' and 'B') were partially cloned from the fifth instar larvae of S. exigua by conserved degenerate primers using nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). They showed high homologies with known cecropins from other lepidopteran species. Northern analysis using the cecropin probe showed that the injection of the heat-killed X. nematophila induced significant expression of a cecropin mRNA transcript (approximately 1.1 kb), but the larvae injected with the live bacteria did not show the corresponding transcript. Injection of arachidonic acid did not rescue the inhibition of X. nematophila based on either antibacterial activity or cecropin gene expression. The addition of dexamethasone, a specific phospholipase A2 inhibitor, did not inhibit antibacterial activity or cecropin gene expression when the larvae were injected with heat-killed X. nematophila. These results suggest that X. nematophila inhibits the antibacterial humoral immune reaction as well as the cellular immune reaction in S. exigua and that the inhibition of X. nematophila on the expression of the antibacterial peptide is not associated with inhibition of the eicosanoid pathway.},

abstract = {Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria colonize the intestines of the infective soil-dwelling stage of entomophagous nematodes, Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, respectively. These nematodes infect susceptible insect larvae and release the bacteria into the insect blood. The bacteria kill the insect larvae and convert the cadaver into a food source suitable for nematode growth and development. After several rounds of reproduction the nematodes are recolonized by the bacteria before emerging from the insect cadaver into the soil to search for a new host. Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria therefore engage in both pathogenic and mutualistic interactions with different invertebrate hosts as obligate components of their life cycle. In this review we aim to describe current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms utilized by Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus to control their host-dependent interactions. Recent work has established that there is a trade-off between pathogenicity and mutualism in both these species of bacteria suggesting that the transition between these interactions must be under regulatory control. Despite the superficial similarity between the life cycles of these bacteria, it is now apparent that the molecular components of the regulatory networks controlling pathogenicity and mutualism in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are very different.},

abstract = {One stage in the symbiotic interaction between the bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila and its nematode host, Steinernema carpocapsae, involves the species-specific colonization of the nematode intestinal vesicle by the bacterium. To characterize the bacterial molecular determinants that are essential for vesicle colonization, we adapted and applied a signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) screen to this system. We identified 15 out of 3000 transposon mutants of X. nematophila with at least a 15-fold reduction in average vesicle colonization. These 15 mutants harbour disruptions in nine separate loci. Three of these loci have predicted open reading frames (ORFs) with similarity to genes (rpoS, rpoE, lrp) encoding regulatory proteins; two have predicted ORFs with similarity to genes (aroA, serC) encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; one, designated nilB (nematode intestine localization), has an ORF with similarity to a gene encoding a putative outer membrane protein (OmpU) in Neisseria; and three, nilA, nilC and nilD, have no apparent homologues in the public database. nilA, nilB and nilC are linked on a single 4 kb locus. nilB and nilC are > 104-fold reduced in their ability to colonize the nematode vesicle and are predicted to encode membrane-localized proteins. The nilD locus contains an extensive repeat region and several small putative ORFs. Other than reduced colonization, the nilB, nilC and nilD mutants did not display alterations in any other phenotype tested, suggesting a specific role for these genes in allowing X. nematophila to associate with the nematode host.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symbioses between invertebrates and prokaryotes are biological systems of particular interest in order to study the evolution of mutualism. The symbioses between the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema and their bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus are very tractable model systems. Previous studies demonstrated (i) a highly specialized relationship between each strain of nematodes and its naturally associated bacterial strain and (ii) that mutualism plays a role in several important life history traits of each partner such as access to insect host resources, dispersal and protection against various biotic and abiotic factors. The goal of the present study was to address the question of the impact of Xenorhabdus symbionts on the progression and outcome of interspecific competition between individuals belonging to different Steinernema species. For this, we monitored experimental interspecific competition between (i) two nematode species: S. carpocapsae and S. scapterisci and (ii) their respective symbionts: X. nematophila and X. innexi within an experimental insect-host (Galleria mellonella). Three conditions of competition between nematodes were tested: (i) infection of insects with aposymbiotic IJs (i.e. without symbiont) of both species (ii) infection of insects with aposymbiotic IJs of both species in presence of variable proportion of their two Xenorhabdus symbionts and (iii) infection of insects with symbiotic IJs (i.e. naturally associated with their symbionts) of both species.

RESULTS: We found that both the progression and the outcome of interspecific competition between entomopathogenic nematodes were influenced by their bacterial symbionts. Thus, the results obtained with aposymbiotic nematodes were totally opposite to those obtained with symbiotic nematodes. Moreover, the experimental introduction of different ratios of Xenorhabdus symbionts in the insect-host during competition between Steinernema modified the proportion of each species in the adults and in the global offspring.

CONCLUSION: We showed that Xenorhabdus symbionts modified the competition between their Steinernema associates. This suggests that Xenorhabdus not only provides Steinernema with access to food sources but also furnishes new abilities to deal with biotic parameters such as competitors.},

abstract = {We link two-allele population models by Haldane and Fisher with Kimura's diffusion approximations of the Wright-Fisher model, by considering continuous-state branching (CB) processes which are either independent (model I) or conditioned to have constant sum (model II). Recent works by the author allow us to further include logistic density-dependence (model III), which is ubiquitous in ecology. In all models, each allele (mutant or resident) is then characterized by a triple demographic trait: intrinsic growth rate r, reproduction variance sigma and competition sensitivity c. Generally, the fixation probability u of the mutant depends on its initial proportion p, the total initial population size z, and the six demographic traits. Under weak selection, we can linearize u in all models thanks to the same master formula u = p + p(1 - p)[g(r)s(r) + g(sigma)s(sigma) + g(c)s(c)] + o(s(r),s(sigma),s(c), where s(r) = r' - r, s(sigma) = sigma-sigma' and s(c) = c - c' are selection coefficients, and g(r), g(sigma), g(c) are invasibility coefficients (' refers to the mutant traits), which are positive and do not depend on p. In particular, increased reproduction variance is always deleterious. We prove that in all three models g(sigma) = 1/sigma and g(r) = z/sigma for small initial population sizes z. In model II, g(r) = z/sigma for all z, and we display invasion isoclines of the 'mean vs variance' type. A slight departure from the isocline is shown to be more beneficial to alleles with low sigma than with high r. In model III, g(c) increases with z like ln(z)/c, and g(r)(z) converges to a finite limit L > K/sigma, where K = r/c is the carrying capacity. For r > 0 the growth invasibility is above z/sigma when z < K, and below z/sigma when z > K, showing that classical models I and II underestimate the fixation probabilities in growing populations, and overestimate them in declining populations.},

These nematode-bacteria symbioses are extremely diversified and constitute an important new model in ecology and evolution to investigate symbioses between microbes and invertebrates. However, no study has so far adequately evaluated either the outcome of the interactions or the obligate nature of interactions in different Steinernema species in the same way. Studying three different species of Steinernema, we showed that symbiotic nematodes are always fitter than aposymbiotic ones. Nevertheless, we revealed contrasting types of interaction in terms of outcome and obligate nature of the interaction. Bacterial analyses showed that nematode species differed dramatically in the number of symbiotic Xenorhabdus they carried. We suggested that when the interaction appeared more facultative for a nematode species, the nematodes carried fewer Xenorhabdus cells than strongly dependent worm species. Thus, the symbiont transmission appeared to become more efficient as the relationship between the nematode and the bacteria became tighter.},

abstract = {Competition among different parasite genotypes within a host is predicted to affect virulence. The direction of this effect, however, depends critically on the mechanisms that parasites use to compete or to cooperate with each other. One mechanism that bacteria use to compete with each other is via the production of bacteria-killing toxins, called bacteriocins. This warfare among parasites within a host is predicted to reduce the rate of host exploitation, resulting in lower virulence. By contrast, if parasites within a host are highly related, there could be a reduction in within-host conflict, increasing virulence. We examined this idea by allowing an insect-parasitic nematode (Steinernema carpocapsae) and its symbiotic bacteria (Xenorhabdus nematophila) to evolve for 20 passages under two different migration treatments (low and high). We found that host mortality rates were higher in the low-migration treatment when compared with the high-migration treatment. In addition, bacteria isolated from the same insect host inhibited each other's growth, but only in the high-migration treatment. These results show that population structure and interactions among parasites within hosts can be critical to understanding virulence.},

abstract = {In natural populations, dispersal tends to be limited so that individuals are in local competition with their neighbours. As a consequence, most behaviours tend to have a social component, e.g. they can be selfish, spiteful, cooperative or altruistic as usually considered in social evolutionary theory. How social behaviours translate into fitness costs and benefits depends considerably on life-history features, as well as on local demographic and ecological conditions. Over the last four decades, evolutionists have been able to explore many of the consequences of these factors for the evolution of social behaviours. In this paper, we first recall the main theoretical concepts required to understand social evolution. We then discuss how life history, demography and ecology promote or inhibit the evolution of helping behaviours, but the arguments developed for helping can be extended to essentially any social trait. The analysis suggests that, on a theoretical level, it is possible to contrast three critical benefit-to-cost ratios beyond which costly helping is selected for (three quantitative rules for the evolution of altruism). But comparison between theoretical results and empirical data has always been difficult in the literature, partly because of the perennial question of the scale at which relatedness should be measured under localized dispersal. We then provide three answers to this question.},

abstract = {The ability of bacteria to evolve resistance to antibiotics has been much reported in recent years. It is less well-known that within populations of bacteria there are cells which are resistant due to a non-inherited phenotypic switch to a slow-growing state. Although such 'persister' cells are receiving increasing attention, the evolutionary forces involved have been relatively ignored. Persistence has a direct benefit to cells because it allows survival during catastrophes-a form of bet-hedging. However, persistence can also provide an indirect benefit to other individuals, because the reduced growth rate can reduce competition for limiting resources. This raises the possibility that persistence is a social trait, which can be influenced by kin selection. We develop a theoretical model to investigate the social consequences of persistence. We predict that selection for persistence is increased when: (a) cells are related (e.g. a single, clonal lineage); and (b) resources are scarce. Our model allows us to predict how the level of persistence should vary with time, across populations, in response to intervention strategies and the level of competition. More generally, our results clarify the links between persistence and other bet-hedging or social behaviours.},

abstract = {Our current understanding on how pathogens evolve relies on the hypothesis that pathogens' transmission is traded off against host exploitation. In this study, we surveyed the possibility that trade-offs determine the evolution of the bacterial insect pathogen, Xenorhabdus nematophila. This bacterium rapidly kills the hosts it infects and is transmitted from host cadavers to new insects by a nematode vector, Steinernema carpocapsae. In order to detect trade-offs in this biological system, we produced 20 bacterial lineages using an experimental evolution protocol. These lineages differ, among other things, in their virulence towards the insect host. We found that nematode parasitic success increases with bacteria virulence, but their survival during dispersal decreases with the number of bacteria they carry. Other bacterial traits, such as production of the haemolytic protein XaxAB, have a strong impact on nematode reproduction. We then combined the result of our measurements with an estimate of bacteria fitness, which was divided into a parasitic component and a dispersal component. Contrary to what was expected in the trade-off hypothesis, we found no significant negative correlation between the two components of bacteria fitness. Still, we found that bacteria fitness is maximized when nematodes carry an intermediate number of cells. Our results therefore demonstrate the existence of a trade-off in X. nematophila, which is caused, in part, by the reduction in survival this bacterium causes to its nematode vectors.},

abstract = {The trade-off hypothesis proposes that the evolution of pathogens' virulence is shaped by a link between virulence and contagiousness. This link is often assumed to come from the fact that pathogens are contagious only if they can reach high parasitic load in the infected host. In this paper we present an experimental test of the hypothesis that selection on fast replication can affect virulence. In a serial passage experiment, we selected 80 lines of the bacterial insect-pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila to multiply fast in an artificial culture medium. This selection resulted in shortened lag phase in our selected bacteria. We then injected these bacteria into insects and observed an increase in virulence. This could be taken as a sign that virulence in Xenorhabdus is linked to fast multiplication. But we found, among the selected lineages, either no link or a positive correlation between lag duration and virulence: the most virulent bacteria were the last to start multiplying. We then surveyed phenotypes that are under the control of the flhDC super regulon, which has been shown to be involved in Xenorhabdus virulence. We found that, in one treatment, the flhDC regulon has evolved rapidly, but that the changes we observed were not connected to virulence. All together, these results indicate that virulence is, in Xenorhabdus as in many other pathogens, a multifactorial trait. Being able to grow fast is one way to be virulent. But other ways exist which renders the evolution of virulence hard to predict.},

abstract = {Coevolution in mutualistic symbiosis can yield, because the interacting partners share common interests, to coadaptation: hosts perform better when associated with symbionts of their own locality than with others coming from more distant places. However, as the two partners of a symbiosis might also experience conflicts over part of their life cycle, coadaptation might not occur for all life-history traits. We investigated this issue in symbiotic systems where nematodes (Steinernema) and bacteria (Xenorhabdus) reproduce in insects they have both contributed to kill. Newborn infective juveniles (IJs) that carry bacteria in their intestine then disperse from the insect cadaver in search of a new host to infect. We ran experiments where nematodes coinfect insects with bacteria that differ from their native symbiont. In both Steinernema carpocapsae/Xenorhabdus nematophila and Steinernema feltiae/Xenorhabdus bovienii symbioses, we detected an overall specificity which favours the hypothesis of a fine-tuned co-adaptation process. However, we also found that the life-history traits involved in specificity strongly differ between the two model systems: when associated with strains that differ too much from their native symbionts, S. carpocapsae has low parasitic success, whereas S. feltiae has low survival in dispersal stage.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the investment of entomopathogenic Steinernema nematodes (Rhabditidae) in their symbiotic association with Xenorhabdus bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae). Their life cycle comprises two phases: (1) a free stage in the soil, where infective juveniles (IJs) of the nematode carry bacteria in a digestive vesicle and search for insect hosts, and (2) a parasitic stage into the insect where bacterial multiplication, nematode reproduction, and production of new IJs occur. Previous studies clearly showed benefits to the association for the nematode during the parasitic stage, but preliminary data suggest the existence of costs to the association for the nematode in free stage. IJs deprived from their bacteria indeed survive longer than symbiotic ones. Here we show that those bacteria-linked costs and benefits lead to a trade-off between fitness traits of the symbiotic nematodes. Indeed IJs mortality positively correlates with their parasitic success in the insect host for symbiotic IJs and not for aposymbiotic ones. Moreover mortality and parasitic success both positively correlate with the number of bacteria carried per IJ, indicating that the trade-off is induced by symbiosis. Finally, the trade-off intensity depends on parental effects and, more generally, is greater under restrictive environmental conditions.},

A new result is presented for the distribution of allele types in a sample of N individuals from an island when the allele frequencies among immigrants are constant. The sampling distribution of allele types depends on the sample size N, the array of allele frequencies among immigrants p, and the parameter theta=phi/lambda, where phi is the immigration rate and lambda is the individual birth rate. The sampling distribution of alleles does not depend on time or population size, and no "genetic equilibrium" assumption is therefore needed to apply the model to natural populations. The moments of the sampling distribution of allele types are used to calculate the expectation and variance of a sample identity by descent estimate (fN 0) within islands under the BDI model.},

Population growth (or decline) is assumed to be exponential. The estimates of growth rate are biased upwards, especially when 4Nemu is low; there is also a slight upwards bias in the estimate of 4Nemu itself due to correlation between the parameters. This bias cannot be attributed solely to Metropolis-Hastings sampling but appears to be an inherent property of the estimator and is expected to appear in any approach which estimates growth rate from genealogy structure. Sampling additional unlinked loci is much more effective in reducing the bias than increasing the number or length of sequences from the same locus.},

abstract = {The fixation probability, the probability that the frequency of a particular allele in a population will ultimately reach unity, is one of the cornerstones of population genetics. In this review, we give a brief historical overview of mathematical approaches used to estimate the fixation probability of beneficial alleles. We then focus on more recent work that has relaxed some of the key assumptions in these early papers, providing estimates that have wider applicability to both natural and laboratory settings. In the final section, we address the possibility of future work that might bridge the gap between theoretical results to date and results that might realistically be applied to the experimental evolution of microbial populations. Our aim is to highlight the concrete, testable predictions that have arisen from the theoretical literature, with the intention of further motivating the invaluable interplay between theory and experiment.},

abstract = {Our current understanding on how pathogens evolve relies on the hypothesis that pathogens' transmission is traded off against host exploitation. In this study, we surveyed the possibility that trade-offs determine the evolution of the bacterial insect pathogen, Xenorhabdus nematophila. This bacterium rapidly kills the hosts it infects and is transmitted from host cadavers to new insects by a nematode vector, Steinernema carpocapsae. In order to detect trade-offs in this biological system, we produced 20 bacterial lineages using an experimental evolution protocol. These lineages differ, among other things, in their virulence towards the insect host. We found that nematode parasitic success increases with bacteria virulence, but their survival during dispersal decreases with the number of bacteria they carry. Other bacterial traits, such as production of the haemolytic protein XaxAB, have a strong impact on nematode reproduction. We then combined the result of our measurements with an estimate of bacteria fitness, which was divided into a parasitic component and a dispersal component. Contrary to what was expected in the trade-off hypothesis, we found no significant negative correlation between the two components of bacteria fitness. Still, we found that bacteria fitness is maximized when nematodes carry an intermediate number of cells. Our results therefore demonstrate the existence of a trade-off in X. nematophila, which is caused, in part, by the reduction in survival this bacterium causes to its nematode vectors.},

abstract = {The debate over the role of stochasticity is central in evolutionary biology, often summarised by whether or not evolution is predictable or repeatable. Here we distinguish three types of stochasticity: stochasticity of mutation and variation, of individual life histories and of environmental change. We then explain when stochasticity matters in evolution, distinguishing four broad situations: stochasticity contributes to maladaptation or limits adaptation; it drives evolution on flat fitness landscapes (evolutionary freedom); it might promote jumps from one fitness peak to another (evolutionary revolutions); and it might shape the selection pressures themselves. We show that stochasticity, by directly steering evolution, has become an essential ingredient of evolutionary theory beyond the classical Wright-Fisher or neutralist-selectionist debates.},

abstract = {To a first order of approximation, selection is frequency independent in a wide range of family structured models and in populations following an island model of dispersal, provided the number of families or demes is large and the population is haploid or diploid but allelic effects on phenotype are semidominant. This result underlies the way the evolutionary stability of traits is computed in games with continuous strategy sets. In this paper similar results are derived under isolation by distance. The first-order effect on expected change in allele frequency is given in terms of a measure of local genetic diversity, and of measures of genetic structure which are almost independent of allele frequency in the total population when the number of demes is large. Hence, when the number of demes increases the response to selection becomes of constant sign. This result holds because the relevant neutral measures of population structure converge to equilibrium at a rate faster than the rate of allele frequency changes in the total population. In the same conditions and in the absence of demographic fluctuations, the results also provide a simple way to compute the fixation probability of mutants affecting various ecological traits, such as sex ratio, dispersal, life-history, or cooperation, under isolation by distance. This result is illustrated and tested against simulations for mutants affecting the dispersal probability under a stepping-stone model.},

abstract = {Likelihood-based methods of inference of population parameters from genetic data in structured populations have been implemented but still little tested in large networks of populations. In this work, a previous software implementation of inference in linear habitats is extended to two-dimensional habitats, and the coverage properties of confidence intervals are analyzed in both cases. Both standard likelihood and an efficient approximation are considered. The effects of misspecification of mutation model and dispersal distribution, and of spatial binning of samples, are considered. In the absence of model misspecification, the estimators have low bias, low mean square error, and the coverage properties of confidence intervals are consistent with theoretical expectations. Inferences of dispersal parameters and of the mutation rate are sensitive to misspecification or to approximations inherent to the coalescent algorithms used. In particular, coalescent approximations are not appropriate to infer the shape of the dispersal distribution. However, inferences of the neighborhood parameter (or of the product of population density and mean square dispersal rate) are generally robust with respect to complicating factors, such as misspecification of the mutation process and of the shape of the dispersal distribution, and with respect to spatial binning of samples. Likelihood inferences appear feasible in moderately sized networks of populations (up to 400 populations in this work), and they are more efficient than previous moment-based spatial regression method in realistic conditions.},

abstract = {The local density of individuals is seldom uniform in space and time within natural populations. Yet, formal approaches to the process of isolation by distance in continuous populations have encountered analytical difficulties in describing genetic structuring with demographic heterogeneities, usually disregarding local correlations in the movement and reproduction of genes. We formulate exact recursions for probabilities of identity in continuous populations, from which we deduce definitions of effective dispersal () and effective density (D(e)) that generalize results relating spatial genetic structure, dispersal and density in lattice models. The latter claim is checked in simulations where estimates of effective parameters obtained from demographic information are compared with estimates derived from spatial genetic patterns in a plant population evolving in a heterogeneous and dynamic habitat. The simulations further suggest that increasing spatio-temporal correlations in local density reduce and generally decrease the product , with dispersal kurtosis influencing their sensitivity to density fluctuations. As in the lattice model, the expected relationship between the product and the genetic structure statistic a(r) holds under fluctuating density, irrespective of dispersal kurtosis. The product D sigma(2) between observed census density and the observed dispersal rate over one generation will generally be an upwardly biased (up to 400\% in simulations) estimator of in populations distributed in spatially aggregated habitats.},

abstract = {Kin-recognition mechanisms allow helping behaviors to be directed preferentially toward related individuals, and could be expected to evolve in many cases. However, genetic kin recognition requires a genetic polymorphism on which recognition is based, and kin discriminating behaviors will affect the evolution of such polymorphism. It is unclear whether genetic polymorphisms used in kin recognition should be maintained by extrinsic selection pressures or not, as opposite conclusions have been reached by analytical one-locus models and simulations exploring different population structures. We analyze a two-locus model in a spatially subdivided population following the island model of dispersal between demes of finite size. We find that in the absence of mutation, selection eliminates polymorphism in most cases, except with extreme spatial structure and low recombination. With mutation, the population may reach a stable limit cycle over which both loci are polymorphic; however, the average frequency of conditional helping can be high only under strong structure and low recombination. Finally, we review evidence for extrinsic selection maintaining polymorphism on which kin recognition is based.},

abstract = {Natural selection can act at multiple biological levels, often in opposing directions. Viral evolution is an important example, with selection occurring both within infected hosts and between hosts via transmission. A fast-replicating virus may outcompete a slower strain within the same host, however, if rapid viral replication incapacitates the host, this fast-replicating virus may not be transmitted as frequently as its slower counterpart. Such examples of antagonistic multilevel selection arise across biological taxa and scales, from microbial public goods production to male mating strategies. A general formalism for describing and analyzing these diverse systems can identify their common underlying properties. Here I introduce such a unifying framework, which can be intuitively visualized as a stochastic ball-and-urn process. This ball-and-urn process illustrates the dynamics of antagonistic selective forces and allows the systematic derivation of properties with little or no dependence on model parameterization. These properties are consistent with previous studies, both theoretical and empirical, of multilevel selection. In particular I show that selection at the group level is favored when group-level events occur frequently relative to individual-level events, when there is little or no mutation, and when there are many groups relative to the number of individuals in each group. This approach demonstrates how multilevel selection can be understood as a general biological phenomenon, and identifies recurring characteristics that may be independent of specific biological contexts.},

abstract = {Different methods have been developed to consider the effects of statistical associations among genes that arise in population genetics models: kin selection models deal with associations among genes present in different interacting individuals, while multilocus models deal with associations among genes at different loci. It was pointed out recently that these two types of models are very similar in essence. In this paper, we present a method to construct multilocus models in the infinite island model of population structure (where deme size may be arbitrarily small). This method allows one to compute recursions on allele frequencies, and different types of genetic associations (including associations between different individuals from the same deme), and incorporates selection. Recursions can be simplified using quasi-equilibrium approximations; however, we show that quasi-equilibrium calculations for associations that are different from zero under neutrality must include a term that has not been previously considered. The method is illustrated using simple examples.},
